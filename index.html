          Prison Break is an American serial drama television series created by
          Paul Scheuring for Fox. The series revolves around two brothers,
          Lincoln Burrows (Dominic Purcell) and Michael Scofield (Wentworth
          Miller); Burrows has been sentenced to death for a crime he did not
          commit, and Scofield devises an elaborate plan to help his brother
          escape prison and clear his name. Along with creator Paul Scheuring,
          the series is executive-produced by Matt Olmstead, Kevin Hooks, Marty
          Adelstein, Dawn Parouse, Neal H. Moritz, and Brett Ratner who directed
          the pilot episode. The series' theme music, composed by Ramin Djawadi,
          was nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award in 2006. Prison Break is a
          joint production between Original Film, Adelstein/Parouse Productions
          (seasons 1-4), Dawn Olmstead Productions (season 5), Adelstein
          Productions (season 5), One Light Road Productions (season 5) and 20th
          Century Fox Television, and is syndicated by 20th Television.
          <br />
          The series was originally turned down by Fox in 2003, which was
          concerned about the long-term prospects of such a series. Following
          the popularity of serialized prime time television series Lost and 24,
          Fox decided to back production in 2004. The first season received
          mostly positive reviews from critics with universal acclaim from
          audiences.Furthermore, it performed exceptionally in the ratings and
          was originally planned for a 13-episode run, but was extended to
          include an extra nine episodes due to its popularity. The subsequent
          seasons continued to receive strong ratings, however, with some
          critics claiming the show had overstayed its welcome. Prison Break was
          nominated for several industry awards, including the 2005 Golden Globe
          Award for Best Television Series Drama and the 2006 People's Choice
          Award for Favorite New TV Drama, which it won. In the United States,
          all five seasons have been released on DVD and released on Blu-ray
          internationally.
          <br />
          The success of the series has inspired short videos for mobile phones,
          several official tie-ins in print and on the Internet, and a video
          game. A spin-off series, Prison Break: Proof of Innocence, was
          produced exclusively for mobile phones. The series has spawned an
          official magazine and a tie-in novel. The fourth season of Prison
          Break returned from its mid-season break in a new timeslot on April
          17, 2009, for the series' last six episodes. Two additional episodes,
          titled "The Old Ball and Chain" and "Free" were produced, and were
          later transformed into a standalone feature, titled The Final Break.
          The events of this feature take place before the last scene of the
          series finale, and are intended to conclude unfinished plotlines. The
          feature was released on DVD and Blu-ray July 21, 2009.
          <br />
          A nine-episode fifth season was announced by Fox in January 2016. The
          revival series premiered on April 4, 2017, and concluded on May 30. In
          January 2018, Fox confirmed that season 6 was in early development;
          however, in August 2019, Fox announced that it had no current plans to
          revive Prison Break, with Miller stating in late 2020 that he had no
          plans on returning to the series.

        <header><h2>Cast</h2></header>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>Dominic Purcell as Lincoln Burrows: Lincoln is a high school drop-out and a convicted felon, who is wrongfully convicted of the murder of Terence Steadman, the brother of the Vice President of the United States. Purcell was cast three days before the start of production and consequently, he was the last actor to join the original cast. He auditioned for the role while he had a recurring role as Tommy Ravetto on North Shore. Since working on John Doe, Purcell has had an amiable relationship with Fox. Hence, he was sent the pilot script of Prison Break.[23] Scheuring's first impression of Purcell did not convince him as a fit for the role since the actor went to the audition with his hair styled and a tan. However, Purcell's acting won the role. He arrived on the set on the first day of filming with a shaved head, which amazed Scheuring with the physical likeness of the series' two leading actors.[24]</li>
                <li>Wentworth Miller as Michael Scofield: Michael is Lincoln's brother (his last name is his mother's maiden name), and worked as a structural engineer before devoting full-time to his brother's case. In order to save his brother's life, Michael creates an elaborate plan to help his brother escape from prison. In an interview, Paul Scheuring recalled that most of the actors who tested for the role "would come in playing mysterious, but it was so cheesy and false."[24] A week before the start of production, Miller auditioned for the role and impressed Scheuring with his performance; he was cast the following day.[22]</li>
                <li>Amaury Nolasco as Fernando Sucre: Sucre develops a friendship with Michael during time at Fox River State Penitentiary, where he was his cell-mate. Initially, his character's story focuses on his wish to reunite with his fiancée. Upon receiving the pilot script, Nolasco's first thought was that it was "one of those failed pilots that the network did not really want" since most of the series' pilots would have started production by that time. Admitting that he does not like to read, Nolasco was amazed that the script was a "huge page-turner". Prior to his last audition for the role, Nolasco recalled his nervousness, which grew when Paul Scheuring told him that he was their favorite choice. Subsequently, he was cast in the role.[25]</li>
                <li>Robert Knepper as Theodore "T-Bag" Bagwell: T-Bag appears in all five seasons of the series as a cunning, violent, and manipulative psychopath, consistently underestimated by those around him.

                <li>Wade Williams as Brad Bellick (seasons 1-4): Bellick is introduced as the captain of Fox River's correctional officers. After reading the pilot script, Williams initially did not want to portray the role of Bellick because the character was "horrible and despicable". His reluctance stemmed from being the father of a four-year-old daughter. However, his manager persuaded him to audition and Williams landed the role.[25]</li>
                <li>Sarah Wayne Callies as Sara Tancredi (seasons 1-2, 4-5): Sara is the prison doctor at Fox River and the daughter of Governor Frank Tancredi, who is linked into the plot that brings Lincoln to Fox River.

          The first season follows the rescue of Lincoln Burrows, who is accused
          of murdering Terrence Steadman, the brother of Vice President of the
          United States, Caroline Reynolds. Lincoln is sentenced to death and is
          incarcerated in Fox River State Penitentiary where he awaits his
          execution. Lincoln's brother, brilliant structural engineer Michael
          Scofield, is convinced of Lincoln's innocence and formulates an
          elaborate escape plan. In order to gain access to Fox River, Michael
          commits an armed robbery which results in him being sentenced to Fox
          River. In prison, Michael befriends the prison doctor Sara Tancredi
          when he pretends to suffer from Type 1 diabetes, in order to gain
          daily access to the prison's infirmary, where he receives his daily
          insulin shots. The brothers' fight to ward off the execution is aided
          by their lifelong friend Veronica Donovan, who begins to investigate
          the conspiracy that put Lincoln in jail. However, they are hindered by
          covert agents, members of an organization called "The Company". The
          Company was responsible for framing Lincoln, and they did so because
          of Lincoln's father Aldo Burrows, and his former connections with The
          Company. The brothers, along with six inmates, Fernando Sucre,
          Theodore "T-Bag" Bagwell, Benjamin Miles "C-Note" Franklin, David
          "Tweener" Apolskis, John Abruzzi, and Charles "Haywire" Patoshik, who
          come to be known as the Fox River Eight, escape in the episode
          immediately prior to the season finale, after using their prison
          industry privileges to dig an escape tunnel underneath the prison.

          The second season begins eight hours after the escape, focusing mainly
          on the eight escapees. Series creator Paul Scheuring describes the
          second season as "The Fugitive times eight" and likens it to the
          "second half of The Great Escape."[10] The fugitives split up and
          journey to locations across the country with the authorities close
          behind them as they each pursue their individual goals. Brad Bellick
          gets fired from the prison where he worked as the main guard and
          chases after the inmates himself for the reward money. Several of the
          escapees reunite in search of a large cache of money buried long ago
          by another Fox River inmate, Charles Westmoreland. Federal agent
          Alexander Mahone is assigned to track down and capture the eight
          fugitives, but is revealed to be working for The Company, which wants
          all eight men dead. When Sara discovers her father, Governor Frank
          Tancredi, has been killed, she meets with Michael, remaining with him
          as the brothers try to bring down now-President Reynolds, a Company
          member. To ensure the brothers' safety, Sara allows herself to be
          arrested and faces trial. During the trial, the testimony of former
          Secret Service agent Paul Kellerman, who used to work for The
          Company-controlled President, exonerates Lincoln and Sara. Half of the
          escapees are killed or recaptured, but the brothers make it to Panama.
          Michael, T-Bag, Mahone, and Bellick are arrested by the Panamanian
          authorities and imprisoned at the Penitenciaría Federal de Sona.

          The third season follows Michael inside Sona and Lincoln on the
          outside in Panama. Sona is a prison run by the inmates and guarded
          only from the outside, due to a riot the year before. Inmates are only
          supplied with food and water and are expected to distribute and serve
          fellow inmates independently. The surrounding landscape is monitored
          by armed guards, who shoot at the sight of inmates escaping. Burrows
          is quickly contacted by Gretchen Morgan (a Company's operative who was
          in charge of operations in Panama) who kidnapped his son LJ and Sara,
          the woman Michael loves. He is told that The Company wants Scofield to
          break James Whistler out of Sona. The season follows Michael and
          Whistler's trials in formulating an escape plan, as Michael has to
          deal with extreme tension and as Lincoln deals with The Company's
          operative Gretchen Morgan. Sucre gets a job at the prison to aid
          Michael in his escape plan. When Lincoln attempts to rescue Sara and
          LJ following a clue provided by Sara, Gretchen claims to have beheaded
          Sara and sends Lincoln a head in a box as a warning. As the season
          ends, the pair manage to escape along with Mahone, and another inmate,
          Luis, leaving behind several accomplices including T-Bag and Bellick.
          Sucre's identity is discovered by a prison guard and he is thrown into
          Sona just after the escape. LJ and Sofia (who was captured for a
          guarantee that Whistler would go with her) are traded for Whistler,
          and Michael seeks revenge against Gretchen for Sara's death.

          The major storyline for the fourth season is about a team recruited by
          Homeland Security agent Don Self to obtain Scylla. Although the team
          initially believes it to be The Company's "black book," it is later
          revealed to contain information on an advanced renewable power cell.
          Over the course of the first half of the season, the team obtains
          cards to access Scylla and breaks into The Company's headquarters to
          steal it, Sara is discovered to be alive, Bellick dies when he
          sacrifices himself, and Self is revealed to be a double agent intent
          on selling Scylla to the highest bidder. Reluctantly, Lincoln decides
          to join The Company to get it back, while Michael suffers from a
          hypothalamic hamartoma. He is treated and operated on by The Company.
          Michael later learns that his mother, Christina is still alive and was
          an agent of The Company, who is revealed to acquire Scylla to sell to
          the highest bidder. Eventually, the series' main storyline of the past
          4 seasons ends in Miami, where Scylla is recovered by Michael and the
          team, the General and The Company are taken down, and Sara kills
          Christina. The last two episodes of the season represent the series
          finale. In the penultimate episode, Sara is seen buying flowers in
          Panama with her toddler son, Michael, before visiting Michael's grave
          with Lincoln, Sucre and Mahone. The final episode and television movie
          Prison Break: The Final Break show what happened between the takedown
          of The Company and Michael's death. This story involves the
          incarceration of Sara in Miami-Dade county penitentiary for
          Christina's murder. The General and T-Bag are in the adjacent men's
          facility. The General wants Sara dead and has put a $100,000 bounty on
          her. Michael hears of the bounty and devises a plan to break Sara out.
          In the end, knowing that he is dying from a brain tumor, Michael
          sacrifices himself for Sara to escape.

          In June 2015, it was reported that a revival was in development at
          Fox. The limited series is a sequel to the original series, taking
          place several years later and features Wentworth Miller and Dominic
          Purcell reprising their roles as well as the return of series creator
          Paul Scheuring. Despite Michael being killed in the series finale, Fox
          CEO Dana Walden said that the series will provide "a logical and
          believable explanation to why the characters are alive and still
          moving around the world". In January 2016, Fox officially ordered the
          revival to series, with the episode order revised to nine episodes. In
          March 2016, it was confirmed that Sarah Wayne Callies, Amaury Nolasco,
          Robert Knepper, Rockmond Dunbar and Paul Adelstein would reprise their
          roles. Filming began in April 2016 in Vancouver, and several Moroccan
          cities including Rabat, Casablanca, and Ouarzazate. It debuted on
          April 4, 2017, and aired on Tuesdays at 9:00 pm.
